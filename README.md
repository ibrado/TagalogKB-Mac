Tagalog (Baybayin) keyboard layout for Macs
-------------------------------------------

Update: I had problems installing [the bundle from nordenx's Baybayin Modern Fonts](http://nordenx.blogspot.com/2012/05/baybayin-unicode-keyboard-layout-for.html) in Mojave, but found out that using its `keylayout` file works just fine. I'm updating the one in this repo with a copy of the keylayout from that bundle, for those who may be running into problems using the said bundle and stumble upon this repo. All credit for the layout goes to [Nordenx](http://nordenx.blogspot.com/).


Old README
----------

Here's a layout for the Tagalog ([*Baybayin*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin), also known incorrectly as *Alibata*) keyboard. Extract and move the two files to *~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/*, then go to *System Preferences/Keyboardi/Input Sources*, click the *+*, select *Others*, select *Tagalog*, and click *Add*.

I tried to follow [Paul Morrow](http://www.mts.net/~pmorrow/)'s font convention as closely as possible, but I kept the punctuation marks and digits and moved the Spanish kudlit/virama consonants under Alt/Option (you can still hit Alt-= to get the virama separately).

Has *Ra* as U+170D (per Paul Morrow fonts) and Shift-*Ra* as U+172D (per current *Baybayin Modern Fonts* by [Nordenx](http://nordenx.blogspot.com/)). Alt-, maps to the single vertical bar, and Alt-. to the double bar. Default X maps to *k+s*. Function keys and Option commands (e.g. *Copy*, *Paste*) should work.

Please use [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele) to view/edit the keyboard layout.
