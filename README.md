Tagalog (Baybayin) keyboard layout for Macs
-------------------------------------------

Here's a layout for the Tagalog ([*Baybayin*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin), also known incorrectly as *Alibata*) keyboard. Extract and move the two files to *~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/*, then go to *System Preferences/Keyboardi/Input Sources*, click the *+*, select *Others*, select *Tagalog*, and click *Add*.

I tried to follow [Paul Morrow](http://www.mts.net/~pmorrow/)'s font convention as closely as possible, but I kept the punctuation marks and digits and moved the Spanish kudlit/virama consonants under Alt/Option (you can still hit Alt-= to get the virama separately).

Has *Ra* as U+170D (per Paul Morrow fonts) and Shift-*Ra* as U+172D (per current *Baybayin Modern Fonts* by [Nordenx](http://nordenx.blogspot.com/)). Alt-, maps to the single vertical bar, and Alt-. to the double bar. Default X maps to *k+s*. Function keys and Option commands (e.g. *Copy*, *Paste*) should work.

Please use [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele) to view/edit the keyboard layout.
